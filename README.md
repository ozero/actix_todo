# An Actix Todo App on Render

This repo can be used as a starting point to deploy [Actix](https://actix.rs) web applications written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) on Render.

It uses a PostgreSQL database and is based on the official [actix_todo](https://github.com/actix/examples/tree/master/actix_todo) example.

The sample app is up at https://actix-todo.onrender.com.

## Deployment

See the guide at https://render.com/docs/deploy-actix-todo.
